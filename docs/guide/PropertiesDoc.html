Keywords: AVERAGE, DENSITY and NONLOCAL_DENSITY

\section description Description

Three groups of operators are currently implemented.
<ul>
<li>AVERAGE: this the preferred framework for evaluation of
expectation values. Results are written directly into the global
log-file, can be post-processed with gosling and error bars for the
quantities are therefore available. However, if the quantity is large
(e.g. 3D matrix) then this approach may become inconvenient due to
large amount of data stored in the log-file. In the case the error bars
are not required, older framework of DENSITY and NONLOCAL_DENSITY is
still useful.
<li>DENSITY: results are written to separate files for each
operator. This is largely deprecated except for one-particle density
evaluated on a 3D grid. Only local operators are accessible via this
keyword.
<li>NONLOCAL_DENSITY: analogous to DENSITY, but for non-local
operators. Note that these are not available (and will be ignored)
within Reptation Monte Carlo.
</ul>

<p>
To evaluate an operator within a given method (VMC, DMC or RMC), include
the following line into that method's input section
</p>

<pre>
&lt;keyword> { &lt;operator> &lt;options of the selected operator> }
</pre>

<p>
For simultaneous evaluation of several operators just repeat the above
section for each operator to be evaluated.
