Keywords: AVERAGE, DENSITY and NONLOCAL_DENSITY

\section description Description

Three groups of operators are currently implemented.
<ul>
<li>AVERAGE: this the preferred framework for evaluation of
expectation values. Results are written directly into the global
log-file that is to be post-processed with gosling to obtain
statistical error bars. AVERAGE contains both local and non-local
operators. Note that although no error/warning is generated,
the "center" estimator of a non-local operator in the \ref
Reptation_methodDoc does not correspond to the pure estimator and it
is, in general, rather useless number.
<li>DENSITY: results are written to separate files for each
operator. Only local operators are accessible via this
keyword. Evaluation of error bars is not available.
<li>NONLOCAL_DENSITY: analogous to DENSITY, but for non-local
operators. Note that these are not available (and will be ignored)
within \ref Reptation_methodDoc . As with DENSITY, evaluation of error
bars is not available.
</ul>

<p>
To evaluate an operator within a given method (VMC, DMC or RMC), include
the following line into that method's input section
</p>

<pre>
&lt;keyword> { &lt;operator> &lt;options of the selected operator> }
</pre>

<p>
For simultaneous evaluation of several operators just repeat the above
section for each operator to be evaluated.
