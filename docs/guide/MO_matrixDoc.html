Keyword: CUTOFF_MO, STANDARD_MO, BLAS_MO, and MO_1D

\section description Description

There are several plugins that both calculate molecular orbitals.  The main 
one, which should usually be used, is the cutoff MO, which takes advantage
of short-range basis functions and symmetry in the wavefunction to 
drastically reduce the computation time, at least by a factor of N, in 
some cases a factor of N<sup>2</sup>.  The STANDARD_MO calculates exactly
the wave function given in the input, which is useful for sanity checking
and wavefunctions like plane waves, where almost no coefficients are zero
and the basis range is infinite.  BLAS_MO is only usable if you compile
the BLAS linear algebra libraries into the code, and cuts off the basis
functions, but uses linear algebra routines to fill the molecular orbital
matrix.  This gives formal scaling as O(N<sup>2</sup>), but can be much
faster than CUTOFF_MO in some circumstances(especially on Itanium processors).
These all take the same input.

MO_1D is a special MO evaluator for one-dimensional systems, and takes
special input.
