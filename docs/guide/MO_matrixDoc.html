\section description Description

There are several plugins that both calculate molecular orbitals.  The main 
one, which should usually be used, is the cutoff MO, which takes advantage
of short-range basis functions and symmetry in the wave function to 
drastically reduce the computation time, at least by a factor of N, in 
some cases a factor of N<sup>2</sup>.  The STANDARD_MO calculates exactly
the wave function given in the input, which is useful for sanity checking
and wave functions like plane waves, where almost no coefficients are zero
and the basis range is infinite.  BLAS_MO is only usable if you compile
the BLAS linear algebra libraries into the code, and cuts off the basis
functions, but uses linear algebra routines to fill the molecular orbital
matrix.  This gives formal scaling as O(N<sup>2</sup>), but can be much
faster than CUTOFF_MO in some circumstances (especially on Itanium
processors). These all take the same input.

Above described plugins calculate molecular orbitals \f$ \phi \f$ as
linear combinations of basis functions \f$ b \f$,
\f$ \phi_i=\sum_j \alpha_{ij} b_j \f$. In certain situations, basis
functions themselves already are one-particle orbitals, for instance
plane waves in homogeneous electron gas. In these cases
\f$ \alpha_{ij}=\alpha_{ij} \f$ and it is more efficient (and
transparent) to completely drop the summation over <i>j</i>
completely. BASFUNC_MO/CBASFUNC_MO are implemented to take advantage of
this simplification. The former is for real-valued basis functions,
the latter for complex-valued.

MO_1D is a special MO evaluator for one-dimensional systems, and takes
special input (not documented at the moment, a version of it was used
to perform calculations published in Vagner et al.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;basis#(for center)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Center#<br>
No coefficients are given as only links between basis functions and
molecular orbitals are performed in these orbital calculators.
