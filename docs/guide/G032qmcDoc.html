\section notes Notes on running Gaussian

Options necessary: <br>
<table>
<tr> <td> iop(3/24=10) <td> Print gaussian functions
<tr> <td> iop(3/18=1) <td> Print pseudopotentials
<tr> <td> 6d 10f <td> Use 6d and 10f functions, which is what the converter was written for (this requirement could be removed in the future, if someone has the will)
</table>

Useful options
<table>
<tr> <td> pseudo=read <td> read in the pseudopotentials
<tr> <td> gen <td> i.e., UHF/gen, etc.  Allows you to enter the 
</table>

For example, your com file may look like
<pre>
%chk=foo.chk
#P B3LYP/gen 6d 10f scf opt test iop(3/24=10) iop(3/18=1) pseudo=read
 ...
</pre>
After running g03 (g03 foo.com, for example), you must then format the
check file as
<pre>
formchk foo.chk foo.fchk
</pre>
and finally you're ready to use the converter.

\section description Description

Basic usage: g032qmc -log foo.log fchk foo.fchk -out [outputoot]  <br>
Additional options: <br>
<table>
<tr> <td> Option <td> Description 
<tr> <td> -out [comfile] <td> Use [outputroot] as the base for the QWalk run.
G032qmc will then create files like outputroot.slater, etc.
<tr> <td> -h <td> print help message for more advanced usage
</table>
