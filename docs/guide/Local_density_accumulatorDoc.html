\section description Description

These are local functions that do not require wave function information and are generally too big to put into the log file and calculate error bars like normal local variables.  Examples include the one-particle density, g(r), and S(k).  The only well-tested object at the moment is the one-particle density.

\section description Description

Collects the one-particle density 
\f$ \rho(r)=\int dr_2...dr_N \Psi^2(r,r_2,...,r_N) \f$ and 
stores it in the Gaussian cube file format readable by VMD or 
other quantum chemistry visualization software.  It also outputs an OpenDX format file.

 they will be set to include all atoms.  If
the system has periodic boundary conditions, then they will be set to the 
smallest orthorhombic cell that includes the PBC cell.

density accumulation in bohrs.  Larger resolutions will save on memory and
the surfaces will look smoother, although the smooth_cube utility will 
also improve the appearance of isosurfaces.
