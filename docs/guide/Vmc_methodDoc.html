<tr> <td> <b>Option</b> <td> <b>Type</b> <td> <b> Default </b> 
     <td> <b>Description</b>
<tr> <td> NDECORR   <td> Integer <td> 2 
     <td>  Number of Metropolis steps to take before evaluating the energy.
           Since VMC steps don't require an energy evaluation, this serves
           to decorrelate the averaging points before doing an expensive
           evaluation of the energy(mostly pseudopotentials).

<tr> <td> STORECONFIG <td> String <td> none <td> Write the configurations to 
this file every block.  In parallel, each processor will write its configurations to this file with _n appended, where n is the processor number.
<tr> <td> READCONFIG <td> String <td> none <td> Read from a configuration file
previously written by STORECONFIG.  If there are more or less configurations 
than NCONFIG, new configurations will be generated or old ones left out to
make the number exactly NCONFIG.
<tr> <td> GUIDETYPE <td> String <td> SUMSQUARES 
     <td> Possible options: SUMSQUARES(\f$ \Psi_T^2 = \Psi_1^2+\Psi_2^2 \f$), 
      SUM(\f$ (\Psi_1 + \Psi_2)^2 \f$), FIRST(\f$ \Psi_T = \Psi_1 \f$). Specify
the importance-sampling function. This will importance-sample <b> only</b>
with respect to wave functions defined in the TRIALFUNC section.  Ones
defined in AUX_WF/AUX_SYS will not be used, since they are auxillary, not
guiding functions.
<tr> <td> DYNAMICS <td> Section <td> SPLIT 
     <td> Control the pseudo-dynamics of the sampling.  Insert a 
          \ref DynamicsDoc section here.
