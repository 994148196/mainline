\section description Description

Basic usage: jeep2qmc -ecut [ecut in Hartrees] -o [outputroot]  [jeep output root] <br>

Expects a .sys and .wf file with the given root.  Note that if you don't
use the -o option, the sys file will be written over, so be careful.

Additional options: <br>
<table>
<tr> <td> Option <td> Description 

<tr> <td> -o [outputroot] 
<td> Use [outputroot] as the base for the GOS run.
jeep2qmc will then create files like outputroot.slater, etc.

<tr> <td> -lcao [basis file] 
<td> Do not write out a plane wave wave function, but instead set up 
a \ref pw2lcaoDoc input file.  Except on very small systems, this is probably
the best way to perform a QMC calculation, since plane waves will take
a very long time.
