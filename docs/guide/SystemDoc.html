Keyword: MOLECULE or PERIODIC

\section description Description

Here we specify the Hamiltonian of the calculation, which includes 
the atomic coordinates and the boundary conditions.  Since there's a 
lot of overlap between the choices, we'll list the options together, with 
a note on the differences.

\section options Options

\subsection reqopt Required 

<table>
<tr> <td> <b>Option</b> <td> <b>Type</b> <td> <b>Description</b>
<tr> <td> NSPIN  <td> Section <td> Two integers, the first the number of spin u
electrons and the second the number of spin down.

<tr> <td> ATOM   <td >Section <td>   Add an atom to the system.  The format of
the section is { [label]  [charge] COOR x y z }.  For example, a Lithium atom 
with atomic charge 3 at (.5, 0, -.5) would be ATOM { Li 3 COOR .5 0 -.5 }.

<tr> <td> LATTICEVEC <td> Section <td> (only for PERIODIC) Enforce the 
periodic boundary conditions as a parallelpiped, with three vectors specifying
the edges.  For example, a cubic cell with sides 1.0 a.u. is: <br>
LATTICEVEC { <br>
1.0 0.0 0.0 <br>
0.0 1.0 0.0 <br>
0.0 0.0 1.0 <br>
}

\subsection optopt Optional

<table>
<tr> <td> <b>Option</b> <td> <b>Type</b> <td> <b> Default </b> 
     <td> <b>Description</b>

<tr> <td> CUTOFF_DIVIDER <td> Float <td> 1.0 
      <td> Only in PERIODIC.  Control how many unit cells to generate ghost 
          centers around the simulation cell.  1 is one unit cell, 2 is one 
          half a unit cell, and .5 is 2 unit cells.
<tr> <td> BOUNDING_BOX  <td> Section <td> None 
     <td> Only in MOLECULE.  Enforce periodic boundary conditions without using
          the Ewald summation or ghost atoms.  The format is the same as LATTICEVEC.
<tr> <td> ORIGIN        <td> Section <td> { 0 0 0 } 
     <td> Change the origin of the periodic boundary conditions(in BOUNDING_BOX or LATVEC)
