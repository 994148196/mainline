Keyword: Label of atom this pseudopotential is attached to.

\section description Description

Use an effective nonlocal potential to remove the core electrons from
the system.  This is handled more or less as described in 
Mitas, Shirley, Ceperly,
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.460849">J. Chem. Phys. <b>95</b>,
3467 (1991)</a>. The first word in the pseudopotential section must be
the label of the atom to which is corresponds.  Then the following
options may be put in.
