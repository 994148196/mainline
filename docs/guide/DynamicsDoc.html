\section description Description

A dynamics generator for monte carlo processes.  Different dynamics
are currently somewhat experimental, but the splitting rejection
method is relatively stable, so I'll list it here. (Keyword SPLIT)  The
defaults are close to the optimal ones, so it's best to leave this alone
unless you know what you're doing.

For all-electron atoms, it is best to use the algorithm of Umrigar,
Nightingale, and Runge,
