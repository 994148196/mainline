Keyword: DENSITY

\section description Description

Collects the one-particle density 
\f$ \rho(r)=\int dr_2...dr_N \Psi^2(r,r_2,...,r_N) \f$ and 
stores it in the Gaussian cube file format readable by VMD or 
other quantum chemistry visualization software.  It also outputs an OpenDX format file.

and the system has open boundary conditions(that is, is a molecule),
 they will be set to include all atoms.  If
the system has periodic boundary conditions, then they will be set to the 
smallest orthorhombic cell that includes the PBC cell.  
<tr> <td> RESOLUTION <td> Float <td> .1 <td> Specifies the resolution of the 
density accumulation in bohrs.  Larger resolutions will save on memory and
the surfaces will look smoother, although the smooth_cube utility will 
also improve the appearance of isosurfaces.
