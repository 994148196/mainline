Keyword: SLATER 

\section description Description

A Slater determinant or linear combination of several determinants.
Also can use the same molecular orbitals to create several separate
combinations of determinants.

\subsection reqopt Required 

<table>
<tr> <td> <b>Option</b> <td> <b>Type</b> <td> <b>Description</b>
<tr> <td> DETWT  <td> Section <td> list of the weights of the determinants 
<tr> <td> STATES  <td> Section <td> List of the occupations of the molecular orbitals, first
spin up, then spin down.  For example, a RHF determinant might be <br>
1 2 3 <br>
1 2 3 <br>
and a UHF might be <br>
1 2 3 <br>
4 5 6 <br>
If there are more than one determinant, simply continue listing up and 
down occupations.<br>  Also, list several STATES functions, and they
will be added as separate guiding functions. 
<tr> <td> ORBITALS/<br>CORBITALS <td> Section
<td> Input for a \ref MO_matrixDoc. When ORBITALS section is used,
real-valued wave function is constructed (in the DMC method,
fixed-node algorithm will be applied). When CORBITALS section is used, the
Slater determinant is complex-valued (in the DMC method, fixed-phase
algorithm will be applied).

     <td> <b>Description</b>
<tr> <td> NSPIN  <td> Section <td> same as in SYSTEM <td>  Override the global parameter.
<tr> <td> OPTIMIZE_DET <td> Flag <td> off <td> Optimize the determinantal coefficients.  For a single 
determinant, this does nothing.
