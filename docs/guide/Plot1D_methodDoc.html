\section description Description

Searches given trial wave function and plots its one-dimensional
components. These are basically only one- and two-body terms in the
\ref Jastrow2_wfDoc factor (group resolved). However, since these
\ref Jastrow_groupDoc s are used also as pair orbitals in the
\ref BCS_wfDoc wave function and as backflow transformations, the
method is relatively widely applicable.

The method generates output file with suffix .plt1d (can be overridden
with optional keyword SUFFIX). Discretized independent variable
is the first column and then follow as many columns as plottable
components found in the wave function. Column description is also
included in the header of the output file. It looks something like

<pre>
# column description:
#   distance
#   group 0, one-body, center LI
#   group 1, one-body, center LI
</pre>
