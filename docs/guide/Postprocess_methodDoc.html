Keyword: POSTPROCESSS

\section description Description

This method can evaluate operators on a trace file saved by DMC (or some other method).
The trace file is expected to be a binary file laid out simply as the positions of each electron in (x,y,z) or der, followed by a single double that represents the weight of that walker.
The file should be in C binary format (that is, no headers as in Fortran).

     <td> Skip the first NSKIP configurations. This should be set to the number of warmup blocks times the number of configurations in the DMC run. The number of warmup blocks can be gotten by running gosling on the log file and counting how many blocks are thrown out.
