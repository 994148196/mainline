  Electronic static structure factor given by
  \( S({\bf k})=\frac1N\,\langle\Psi|\hat\rho_{\bf k}
  \hat\rho_{-\bf k}|\Psi\rangle \)
  where \( \hat\rho_{\mathbf{k}} \) is a Fourier component of the
  electron density. The quantity is evaluated either on a full 3D grid
  or on a 1D grid along a fixed direction, see keyword DIRECTION.


  The structure factor \( S({\bf k}) \) can be used to
  evaluate finite-size corrections to the Ewald energy, see Chiesa et al. 
  Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 076404 (2006). Note that \( S({\bf k}) \)
  as calculated contains besides the continuous electronic
  component also sharp Bragg peaks, since electronic wave function
  follows crystal symmetries.  These are the same peaks that X-ray diffraction uses to determine crystal structure.

optional:
  - keyword: NGRID
    type: integer
    default: 5
    description: > 
      Number of grid points in one direction. Structure factor is
      evaluated on NGRID points if DIRECTION is given and on NGRID\(^3\) points
      otherwise.
  - keyword: GVEC
    type: section
    default: reciprocal lattice vectors
    description: > 
      Basis vectors \( {\bf g}_i\) defining the grid. The
      section contains a 3x3 matrix of floats.

  - keyword: DIRECTION
    type: integer
    default: not set
    description: > 
        Selects one of the three basis vectors \( {\bf g}_i \), along
        which \( S({\bf k}) \) is evaluated.
