  Basic usage

      heg2qmc -o (outputroot)  
      heg2qmcc -o (outputroot)
  
  This program guides you into creating a homogeneous electron gas simulation.
  It takes N_up, N_down, and rs from standard input. 'heg2qmc' will only use 
  real k-points and fixed node, while 'heg2qmcc' will create a k-point mesh.

  The Jastrow factor outputroot.jast2 contains only the short-range part.
  outputroot.i.jast2 is k-point dependent with the long-range part expanded 
  in plane waves as PRB 70, 235119 (2004).



  For heg2qmc, the k-points and their weights are given by

  
  
  Index | Weight 
  
  --- | ---

  0 | 1/8 

  1 | 3/8 

  2 | 3/8 

  3 | 1/8 



  For heg2qmcc, the parameter D will correspond to various k-point meshes


  D | Number of k-points
  
  --- | ---

  1 | 4

  2 | 10 

  3 | 20 

  4 | 35

  5 | 56


  The weights are written to the corresponding .sys files as comments.
