  Searches given trial wave function and plots its one-dimensional
  components. These are basically only one- and two-body terms in the
  Jastrow factor (group resolved). However, since these
  Jastrow_groups are used also as pair orbitals in the
  BCS wave function and as backflow transformations, the
  method is relatively widely applicable.

  The method generates output file with suffix .plt1d (can be overridden
  with optional keyword SUFFIX). Discretized independent variable
  is the first column and then follow as many columns as plottable
  components found in the wave function. Column description is also
  included in the header of the output file. It looks something like

      column description
        distance
        group 0, one-body, center LI
        group 1, one-body, center LI
