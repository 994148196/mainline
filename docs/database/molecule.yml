    description: Two integers, the first the number of spin up electrons and the second the number of spin down.
  - keyword: ATOM
    type: section
    description: >
       Add an atom to the system.  The format of 
       the section is label  charge COOR x y z .  For example, a Lithium atom 
       with atomic charge 3 at (.5, 0, -.5) would be ATOM \{ Li 3 COOR .5 0 -.5 \}.
