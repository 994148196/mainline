  Basic usage:  


      nwchem2qmc -o (outputroot)  (nwchem input root)
  
   Unlike gamess, nwchem prints out orbitals in a binary file called
   [input].movecs. So there is an additional step to first convert
   the .movecs to ASCII file. Go to nwchem_directory/contrib/mov2asc/,
   then make it. We need executable file called "mov2asc".

   Then, run
   mov2asc [large number]  [input].movecs [input].nw.vecs.
   Be sure to name the nwchem output file [input].nw.out. So
   [input].nw.vecs and [input].nw.out are the two files we need. Now run
   /qwalk_directory/src/converter/nwchem2qmc [input],
   this generates all the files needed by qwalk.

   The converter only supports the Cartesian representation of the basis; i.e., 6D, 10F, etc.
