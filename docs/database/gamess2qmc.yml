description: > 
  Basic usage:  


      gamess2qmc -o (outputroot)  (gamess output root)
  
  By default, gamess2qmc will take the last geometry in the .out file and the last set of
  molecular orbitals in the .dat file.  This is usually the right
  behavior.  GVB wavefunctions are automatically read in. 


required: []
optional:
  - keyword: -o
    type: filename
    default: GAMESS root
    description: QWalk filenames will start with the value of this option
  - keyword: -virtual
    type: integer
    default: 10
    description: Include this number of virtual orbitals into the orb file. 
  - keyword: -compare_punch
    type: filename
    default: do nothing
    description:  >
      Compares the orbitals in the current punch file to the one specified
      here.  Will print what orbitals have changed/rotated, and if any cannot be 
      mapped between the two wavefunctions.
