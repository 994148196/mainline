  This method attempts to minimize the spread of the orbitals in periodic boundary conditions. It accomplishes this by maximizing the following value
  \[
  \sum_i |z_{ij}|^2
  \]
  where the sum is over all orbitals, and 
  \[
  z_{ij}=\int{ \exp(-\vec{k_j}\cdot\vec{r}) \phi_i^2(\vec{r}) d\vec{r}},
  \]
  where the k's are the reciprocal lattice vectors.

  The orbitals are optimized by rotating the orbitals
  \[
  {\boldsymbol \phi}_{new}=M{\boldsymbol \phi}.
  \]
  The matrix elements of M are allowed to be nonzero only between orbitals that are in the same ORB_GROUP.
