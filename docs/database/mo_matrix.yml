title: Molecular orbital evaluator
description: >
  This is a collection of objects that evaluates orbitals as a linear combination of basis functions, as
  \( \phi_i({\mathbf r})=\sum_j c_{ij} b_j({\mathbf r}) \).
  All of these take the same input; they only differ in how they evaluate the sum.
  Typically BLAS_MO is the fastest implemenation if QWalk was compiled with USE_BLAS, followed by CUTOFF_MO.



  Since there are often many \( c_{ij} \) coefficients, these are stored in a .orb file. Its format is as follows.
  First there is a table with headers MO,AO(on a center),Center, Coefficient number.
  AO is corresponds to the basis label on a given center, that is, \( b_j \).
  Then the keyword COEFFICIENTS, followed by the \( c_{ij} \) in the order given in the table.
  For a complex orbital, the coefficients are in the format (real,imaginary).

  For example, a simple .orb file for H\(_2\) in a minimal basis would be

      1 1 1 1
      1 1 2 2
      2 1 1 3
      2 1 2 4
      COEFFICIENTS
      0.5 0.5 0.5 -0.5

  This defines two molecular orbitals, with orbital 1 bonding and orbital 2 antibonding.
