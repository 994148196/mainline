title: Pseudopotential
description: > 
  Use an effective nonlocal potential to remove the core electrons from
  the system.  This is handled more or less as described in 
  Mitas, Shirley, Ceperly, J. Chem. Phys. 95, 3467 (1991).
  The first word in the pseudopotential section must be
  the label of the atom to which is corresponds.  
required:
  - keyword: BASIS
    type: section
    description: Input for a Basis function for the radial part of the pseudopotential.
optional: 
  - keyword: AIP
    type: integer
    default: 6
    description: >
       Number of atomic integration
       points. Available are Gaussian rules with 4, 6, 12, 18, 26 and 32
       points.
  - keyword: ADD_ZEFF
    type: Flag
    default: off
    description: Add the effective charge while in range of the pseudopotential, for soft psp's that have the effective charge included.
