description: >
  \( z_i=\left\langle \exp(-i{\mathbf k_i} \cdot {\mathbf X}) \right\rangle \), where \( {\mathbf X} = \sum_j {\mathbf r_j} \) and \( {\mathbf k_i} \) is a reciprocal vector of the supercell.

  The magnitude of \( z_i \) is related to the localization length in the direction of the reciprocal lattice vector.
  Its phase gives the center of charge in the unit cell.
