title: Two-body density matrix on a basis
description: >
  This  object evaluates the one and two-body reduced density matrix on a basis. 
  The basis can be any set of functions that can be expressed in a \ref MO_matrixDoc object. 
  Usually this will be a set of orbitals from a mean-field calculation.
  The ORBITALS section can often be copied from the .slater file with no changes.

  The output contains the states section and the density matrices.  One thing to keep in mind is that the density matrices are always labeled from 0 to nmo, where nmo is the number of orbitals in the STATES section.

    description: >
       Input for a set of orbitals. When ORBITALS section is used,
       a real-valued wave function is constructed.  When a CORBITALS section is used,
       the orbitals will be complex-valued.
optional:
  - keyword: STATES
    type: section
    default: All the orbitals in the ORBITALS section.
    description: A list of the orbitals on which you'd like to evaluate the density matrices.
  - keyword: MODE
    type: string
    default: Evaluate all two-particle density matrix elements.
