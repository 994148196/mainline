description: > 
  The PLOT method simply plots the one-particle orbitals and density
  of a trial function. These are output in Gaussian CUBE file format.
  The density, equal to the sum of squares of the orbitals, is also printed.
  This may or may not correspond to the actual electron density of the Slater
  determinant, depending on what orbitals were selected.

  There are some useful Python functions to manipulate CUBE files in qwalk/utils/readcube.py
  

required: 
  - keyword: ORBITALS
    type: section
    description: A section for [molecular orbitals](Orbital).
optional: 
  - keyword: RESOLUTION
    type: float
    default: 0.2
    description: The resolution in Bohrs. Smaller is better resolution.
  - keyword: PLOTORBITALS
    type: section
    default: all orbitals
    description: Which orbitals to plot. The first orbital starts at 1.
  - keyword: MINMAX
    type: section
    default: special

      { xmin xmax ymin ymax zmin zmax }.  
      By default, this is automatically set to include the entire system with some padding.
