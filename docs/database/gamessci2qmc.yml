title: GAMESS CI to QWalk
description: > 
  Basic usage:  


      gamess2qmc -wthresh 0.01 -o qwalk.cidet  ci.out
  
  For CI, one has to be careful that the orbitals used by GAMESS to do
  the CI expansion are the same ones that QWalk reads in.  This is not
  easy for the converter to detect, so you have to take some care
  yourself.  The thing to remember is that gamess2qmc always reads the
  last set of orbitals in the punch file.  This is almost always the
  wrong thing to do during a CI calculation.  Here is a recipe that
  generally works.


  + Do a Hartree-Fock/DFT/whatever calculation as normal

  + Use $GUESS to read in the HF orbitals.  


  + Use gamess2qmc to convert the Hartree-Fock calculation and
  gamessci2qmc to read the determinants and their weights from the CI
  calculation.

  + Replace the single determinant in the slater file with the
  determinants read from the CI.  Make sure to replace NMO with
  NFZC+NDOC+NALP+NVAL.


  An example input for GAMESS could be


         $CONTRL CITYP=GUGA $END
         $CIDRT NPRT=2 NFZC=0 NDOC=1 NALP=2 NVAL=15 IEXCIT=2 $END
         $GUGDIA PRTTOL=0.00001 $END 


  An example command sequence could be

  
      rungms hf >& hf.out
      rungms ci >& ci.out
      gamess2qmc -virtual 15 -o qwalk hf
      gamessci2qmc -wthresh 0.0001 -o qwalk.cidet ci.out

      
  Then construct the ci file as follows


      SLATER 
      ORBITALS {
        CUTOFF_MO
        MAGNIFY 1
        INCLUDE c.basis
        NMO 18
        ORBFILE c.orb
        CENTERS { USEGLOBAL } 
      }
      OPTIMIZE_DET
      include qwalk.cidet

  For small enough cutoff of the determinantal weights, the energy with
  this wave function will match the CI energy.  Often, the QMC energy
  does not need as many determinants to converge, and using
  OPTIMIZE_DET along with a jastrow will improve the convergence in
  determinants within QMC.
