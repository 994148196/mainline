title: Jastrow correlation factor
description: > 
  This wave function's job is to represent the electron-electron correlations. It is a symmetric function with explicit electron-electron distances.
   There are three main terms in this function; electron-ion, electron-electron, and electron-electron-ion.
   In all that follows, the index \( \alpha \) stands for the ion (nucleus) coordinate, the indices \( i,j \) stand for electron-electron distances, and \( k,l,m \) are expansion indices.

   Electron-ion. \( \sum_{i\alpha} \sum_k c_k a_k (r_{i\alpha}) \)

   Electron-electron. \( \sum_{ij} \sum_k c_k b_k (r_{ij}) \)

   Electron-electron-ion. \( \sum_{\alpha ij} \sum_{klm} c_{klm} (a_k(r_{i\alpha})a_l(r_{j\alpha}) + a_k(r_{j\alpha})a_l(r_{i\alpha})  ) b_k (r_{ij}) \)

   For efficiency reasons, the Jastrow factor is organized into GROUP sections. Each GROUP can take one of the options listed below.
