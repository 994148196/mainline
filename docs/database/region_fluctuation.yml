title: Pairwise region fluctuations
description: >
  We define the number operator on as site i for spin \( \sigma \) as 
   \( n_{i,\sigma}= \sum_{j\in \sigma} \Theta(r_j) \), where j is summed over the electrons in the spin \( \sigma \).
   This object calculates the joint probability distribution function  between all pairs of sites and spins, \( \rho( n_{i,\sigma},n_{j,\sigma} ) \).

   The output can be read in by the Python functions in utils/read_numberfluct.py.
