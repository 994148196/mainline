  Set of functions of the form
  \[
  a_n(r) = \frac{1-z(r/b_0)}{1+\beta_n z(r/b_0)}
  \]
  where
  \[
  z(x)=x^2(6-8x+3x^2)
  \]
  and
  \[
   \beta_n=\exp(\beta_0+1.6*n)-1
  \]
  
   This creates a set of monotonically functions that have zero derivative and value equal to 1 at r=0, as well as zero derivative and zero value at \( r= b_0 \).
   \( \beta_0 \) can be optimized and sets the longest distance function.
