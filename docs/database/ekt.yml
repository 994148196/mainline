title: Extended Koopmans theorem matrix elements.
description: > 
   This is to calculate the ionization energy and electron affinity using the extended Koopmans' theorem (EKT). The EKT module compute the following matrix element,


   (1) One-body reduced density matrix. \( \rho_{ij}=\langle \Psi^N |c_i^\dagger c_j|\Psi^N\rangle \), where \( \Psi^N \) is the wave function of the N-electron system, and \( c_i \) is the annihilation operator in second quantization. This matrix elements of \( \rho \) is evaluated as
   \[
   \rho_{ij} =\sum_{n=1}^N \int d\vec r'\left\langle \phi_i(\vec r_n)\phi_j^*(\vec r')\frac{\psi(\vec r_1,\cdots,\vec r',\cdots,\vec r_N)}{\psi(\vec r_1, \cdots, \vec r_n,\cdots,\vec r_N)}\right\rangle_{|\psi|^2} 
   \]
   while \$\phi_i\$ is the orbitals by which the density matrix is represented with.


   (2) Electron ionization matrix. \(V_{ij}^v = \langle \Psi^{N}|c_i^\dagger c_j H -c_i^\dagger H c_j  |\Psi^{N}\rangle\)
   \[
   V_{ij}^v
    =\sum_{n=1}^N\int d\vec r_n'\Big\langle \phi_i(\vec r_n')\phi_j^*(\vec r_n)\frac{\psi^*(\vec r_1, \cdots, \vec r_n', \cdots, \vec r_N)}{\psi^*(\vec r_1, \cdots, \vec r_n, \cdots, \vec r_N)}\frac{H_n \psi(\vec r_1, \cdots, \vec r_n \cdots, \vec r_N)}{ \psi(\vec r_1, \cdots, \vec r_n \cdots, \vec r_N)}\Big\rangle_{|\psi|^2}\,,
   \]
   where \(H_n\) is the hamiltonian corresponds to the n-th particle (including kinetic energy, external potential energy, and coloumb energy from other electrons). 


    (3) Electron affinity matrix. \(V_{ij}^c = \langle \psi^N|c_i [\hat H, c_j^\dagger]|\psi^N\rangle\), which is evaluated as
   \[
   \int \phi_i^*(r_0) \hat h_0\phi_j(r_0)dr_0 + \sum_{n=1}^N \int dr_0 \Bigg[\langle\phi_i^*(\vec r_0)\phi_j(\vec r_0)v(\vec r_0, \vec r_n)\rangle_{|\psi(\vec r_1\cdots r_N)|^2} \nonumber\\
   \quad - \left\langle\frac{\psi^*(\vec r_1,\cdots,\vec r_0,\cdots, \vec r_N)}{\psi^*(\vec r_1,\cdots, \vec r_n, \cdots \vec r_N)}\phi_i^*(\vec r_n)\Big(\phi_j(\vec r_0)\sum_{m=1}^Nv(\vec r_0, \vec r_m)+\hat{h}_0\phi_j(\vec r_0)\Big)\right\rangle_{|\psi(\vec r_1\cdots\vec r_N)|^2}\Bigg]\,,
   \]
   where \( \hat h_0 \) is the kinetic term, and \( v(\vec r_i, \vec r_j)\) is the Coulomb interacting term. 

   The ionization spectrum is obtained by solving the following generalized eigenvalue problem, 
   \[
   [\vec V^v - \epsilon \mathbf{\rho} ]\mathbf{\alpha}  = 0\,.
   \]
   Suppose the number of electron in the system is N. The inonization spectrum corresponds to the lowest N eigenvalues of the equation.

   The electron affinity spectrum is obtained by 
   \[
   (\vec V^c - \epsilon_c \vec S^c)\vec \alpha_c = 0, \quad \vec S = 1 -\vec \rho\,,
   \]
   The electron affinity spectrum corresponds to the eigenvalues start from N+1. 
  
   The EKT should converge as the number of states included increases. However, the stochastic uncertainty also increases with more states. It is often useful to try a few different cutoffs on the number of states in order to converge the results.

   Therefore, in solving the generalized eigenvalue problem, we might include only {1 2 3 ... Ns'}, we increase Ns' before the stochastic error goes up. 


   The output of the EKT can be read in using functions from utils/read_dm.py.
