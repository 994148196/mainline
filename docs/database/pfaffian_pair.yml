  WARNING. This is a development feature. Make sure you know what you're doing before trying to use Pfaffians.
  
  Defines the coefficients of linear combinations of one-particle orbitals from which the pairing orbitals are constructed. 
  The normalization is everywhere such that sum of squares of independent coefficients is equal to 1.
