  A pfaffian (generalized determinant) or several pfaffians. 
  See Bajdich et al. Phys. Rev. B 77 115112 (2008) for implementation details.

  Submatrices \( \boldsymbol \xi \), \( \boldsymbol  \Phi \) and \( \boldsymbol \varphi \) are defined in Pfaffian group.
  and ordered according the ORBITAL_ORDER section.
