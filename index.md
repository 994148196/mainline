QWalk is a program developed to perform high accuracy quantum Monte Carlo calculations of electronic structure in molecules and solids.  It is specifically designed as a research vehicle for new algorithms and method developments, as well as being able to scale up to large system sizes. 

QWalk is freely available for [download](http://github.com/QWalk).  We only ask that
