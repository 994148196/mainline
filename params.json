{"name":"QWalk","tagline":"Quantum Monte Carlo for electrons in real materials","body":"QWalk is a program developed to perform high accuracy quantum Monte Carlo calculations of electronic structure in molecules and solids.  It is specifically designed as a research vehicle for new algorithms and method developments, as well as being able to scale up to large system sizes. \r\n\r\nQWalk is freely available for [download](http://www.qwalk.org/register.html).  We only ask that\r\nyou let us know who you are before you download it, to help with funding. \r\n\r\n## For users \r\nWhen starting, go in this order.\r\n\r\n * Introductory [tutorial video](http://nanohub.org/resources/2816)\r\n * Try the [learning tool](http://www.nanohub.org/resources/2814/) (free registration on NanoHUB)\r\n * [Download releases](http://www.qwalk.org/register.html)\r\n * [Tutorial](https://github.com/QWalk/mainline/wiki/Tutorial)\r\n * [Manual](http://www.qwalk.org/docs/docs Manual)\r\n * [Paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2009.01.017)\r\n\r\n## For developers \r\n * [Contributing](https://github.com/QWalk/mainline/wiki/Contributing)\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements \r\nThe development of the QWalk code has been aided by a number of generous grants.
